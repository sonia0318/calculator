# Calculator
A console calculator written in C++

This project is for practising design, algorithm and coding.

## Development Plan
* Stage 1: core functionality
  - [ ] math expression parser
  - [ ] syntax tree evaluation
  - [ ] command line user interface
  - [ ] error handling
  
* Stage 2: precision enhancement
  - [ ] use GMP/CLN library to implement high precision calculation
  
* Stage 3: scientific calculation functions
  - [ ] implement function evaluation
  - [ ] enhance parser to accept variable argument length function calls (e.g. max(1,2,3))
  - [ ] allowing non-10 based numbers (bin: 0b1011, hex: 0x3af, oct: 01375) and scientific notation
  
* Stage 4: user experience improvement
  - [ ] replace cin/scanf with gnu readline
  
* Stage 5: advanced features
  - [ ] user defined variables and constants
  - [ ] logic and bitwise operators
  - [ ] user defined functions
