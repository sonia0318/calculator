# Calculator
A console calculator written in C++

This project is for practising design, algorithm and coding.

## Development Plan
* Stage 1: core functionality
  - [ ] math expression parsing for basic operators (+, -, \*, /, ^, !), negation and parentheses
  - [ ] syntax tree evaluation
  - [ ] result display
  - [ ] error handling
  
* Stage 2: precision enhancement
  - [ ] use GMP library to implement arbitrary precision calculation
  
* Stage 3: scientific calculation functions
  - [ ] enhance parser to accept function calls (e.g. log(3 * 22))
  - [ ] allowing non-10 based numbers (bin: 0b1011, hex: 0x3af, oct: 01375)
  - [ ] implement function evaluation
  
* Stage 4: user experience improvement
  - [ ] replace cin/scanf with gnu readline
  
* Stage 5: advanced features
  - [ ] user defined variables and constants
